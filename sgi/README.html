This is the source for tools to read the SGI "Image" format pixmap files.
This format is also called "imagelib" even though it is not a library file;
the nickname derives from the set of routines on the SGI that read the files.

SGIIMAGESPEC is the details on the format, straight off SGI's ftp server.

imgutil.c is a few routines adapted straight out of SGIIMAGESPEC (with
minor changes; see the source for details).

imgtopgm.c was a standalone program that reads one file, and writes it out
as an ASCII PBM file. It is now broken, but could be fixed easily.
It could then be used as-is as an Image-to-PBM
converter, or the basis for an Image-to-whatever converter.

imgpshop.c is an Adobe PhotoShop(tm) Plug-in that reads image files.
It has only been built for UNIX platforms, though in theory only
the "About" box SHOULD need major changes. Look for #ifdef UNIX/#ifdef MAC.

With a bit of work the PlugIn could be extended to write Image files too,
though I'm not sure why you'd need or want to, since the SGI software
can usually handle TIFF, and PhotoShop can already write those.

This software is NOT public domain but may be copied under the
terms of the accompanying LEGAL.NOTICE file (not the GPV).
It is free software, free of the encumbrances of the GPL.

Enjoy and, if you really like it, send me money or hardware :-)

implementation by Paul Haeberli of Silicon Graphics. Thanks, Paul!
