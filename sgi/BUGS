BUGS:

If your file isn't called ".rgb" or ".rgba", you have to click "Show
All Files". Sorry about .bw, which is a valid SGI extention.

Is that a missing scanline I see at the bottom?

WARNING - can only read one file at a time, so cannot Revert or read
second file. Workaround: force unload by doing Info->About 
Plug-in->Acquire EPS (or any other plug-in), then retry.
