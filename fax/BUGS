BUGS

The Resolution (DPI) is being ignored; although I set it to 200, it comes
out as 72, resulting in Photoshop thinking that the images are 24 inches wide!
ALWAYS, when you open a file, immediately change the res to 200, with file
size constrained.

The top line of a saved FAX appears to have trash in it.
