<H1>A FAX Plug-in for Adobe Photoshop</H1>
<P>This plug-in reads and writes raw Group 3 format FAX files.
It is just the thing for importing that rough sketch from a client
into Photoshop at 2:00 in the morning before an important demo.
<P>We assume that your FAX software is smart enough (read: non-proprietary
enough!) to save incoming files in a "plain" G3 header.
Software that uses this format on UNIX includes the popular "efax"
package, the popular "faxview" viewer (formerly known as g3view),
and the PBMPLUS routines g3topbm and pbmtog3. And now, of course, Photoshop.
<P>
Some other FAX software uses a TIFF header; for that, just use the Photoshop
TIFF format.
<P>Yet other fax software writes its own, proprietary, secret, undocumented
header, and/or mangles the save file format in exotic ways, just so you
can't use its file with any other software, such as this.
<EM>Get that software off your system</EM> and send it back to the vendor
for a refund, until they use a non-proprietary save file format.
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Do not ask me for help with such software</STRONG>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>Usage</H1>
<P>What can I say? Just use it.
<H2>Installation</H2>
<P>Install the files '%FAX Group 3' and 'FAX Group 3' in your Plug-ins directory
and restart Photoshop. Is all.
<H2>Usage</H2>
Use it like any other format plug-in: Use File->Open if your FAX file
has a name ending in .g3, otherwise use File->OpenAs (Photoshop 2.5)
or File->Open and choose the type of G3. Is all.
<H1>Licensing</H1>
No license is necessary. Anybody in the world can use this software
without payment of any license (or "shareware") fees to anybody.
If you get rich off it, send me a percentage :-)  Is all.
<H1>History</H1>
Most of the source-code for this program is taken from 
three sources:<OL>
<LI>My own SGI Image Format plug-in;
<LI>A small bit of generic Adobe SDK (1995 version) File Format plug-in code, and
<LI>Paul Haeberli's G3 code in the PBMPLUS package.
</OL>
<P>My own code is of little value, and Adobe's code is copyable by
anyone who can download the SDK from their Web site. The most
restrictive copyright, which is pretty free, is therefore Paul
Haeberli's, which is reproduced here:
